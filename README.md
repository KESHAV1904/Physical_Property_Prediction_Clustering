# Physical_Property_Prediction_Clustering
To create a machine learning model that can estimate the physical properties of molecules based only on their chemical structures. This model aims to predict properties like boiling point, melting point, solubility, and vapor pressure, among others, without depending on traditional physical chemistry calculations. The goal is to create a predictive tool that can find the physical properties for new molecules based on the data used to train, whose usage is in drug synthesis and discovery, material science and various other fields where understanding molecular behavior is essential.
